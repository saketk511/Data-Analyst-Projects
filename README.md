# Seismic Activities 2023 Global

Overview
The "Seismic Activities 2023 Global" dataset offers comprehensive insights into earthquakes and seismic activities worldwide during the year 2023. 
This repository contains the exploration and analysis of the dataset, with a focus on understanding temporal, geospatial, and magnitude-related patterns.

Here we will understand the data and prepare it for creating report in Power BI

Steps we will follow here

1.Import the libraries. 
2.Read the data. 
3.Check the head and tail of data. 
4.Check the shape of data. 
5.Check the describe and info function. 
6.Understand the number of unique values in a feature. 
7.Check the null values and fill accordingly. 
8.Check for the outlier and fill accordingly.
9.Creating a clean dataset file.

Analysis in Power BI

Temporal Analysis:
Identify trends and patterns in earthquake occurrences throughout the year.
Analyze temporal correlations between earthquakes.

Geospatial Analysis:
Visualize earthquake distribution on a world map.
Explore regions with higher seismic activity.

Magnitude Analysis:
Examine the distribution of earthquake magnitudes.
Identify significant earthquakes based on magnitude.
